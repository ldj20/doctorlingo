# readability

This is an updated spaCy package from Saadh and I. It grades words/sentences on complexity via common NLP/linguistic scoring tools. This will be integral to the pipline/autointerpreter, but also useful on its own for other experiments/projects, etc.

## USAGE

You must have a functioning version of SpaCy >= 3.0.0
