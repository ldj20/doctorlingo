# Meronymy

Meronymy is another linguistic relationship that is important in NLP. It is a part whole relationship, i.e. a wheel is a part of a bike. 

This is essentially the same methodology as the hypernymy model (see readme from that directory).

The main differences are, there is less robust literature and data on meronymy / meronymy patterns when compared to hypernymy.

This is a less important concept but still relevant as for nouns about 75% of the bulk of relationships are via hypernymy in wordnet and UMLS, meronymy is also a little different for UMLS as you have to think about biological taxonomy, etc. This is not important for now to get model to prod, but would be cool to explore in more detail at a later time in a new version.
