#Format for our corpus:

**--PWN = PWN properties
**--GWN = GWN properties
**--UMLS = UMLS properties

#Top file contains a comma dict of unique TKN:TKN_ID - search function in website searches this. If there, great, literal python dict "get" fx -> the file data; if not there do NLP stuff.
#The other files: a file in python dict format for each unique "TKN:TKN_ID" in our list - a unique entry w/ associated unique ID that connects all others concepts / relations w/ that entry and other entries
#Entries can be words, noun phrases, entities (i.e. Hulk Hogan, Princeton, Clifford the Big Red Dog), etc. Basically any conceptual thing that we use
#In natural medical language - eventually maybe in other fields / all of English / the world / the friggin' universe?

--In order, these properties were properties used in PWN, UMLS, GWN as these are in decreasing order of necessity for syntactic and semantic relations for this corpus to work well.

--Many of the categories from GWN may not be filled into because low yield overall for meaning.


--If TKN is preceded by something, it means it is a relation derived from that specific abbreviations source (see below for abbrv details)
--If TKN is not preceded by something, it means it is a relation that is used amongst many NLP corpora / databases
--If a relation for a word existed in its original source, it should exist here, meaning if you don't see for example a gender property associated w/ UMLS, but you know that UMLS has a gender property, its because that was also a shared wordnet property, since it is unique to neither, we consider it a general property so it will not be preceded by a source.
--If two databases had repeat properties, they were not repeated and concantinated

--Wordnet relation info - for info on semantic/syntantic properties from wordnets see -- GWA schemas page (https://globalwordnet.github.io/schemas/)
--UMLS relation info - for info on TKN_UMLS semantic/syntantic properties from metathesaurus see -- TKN_UMLS Reference Manual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9676/)
--If the relation abbreviation is three capital letters this signifies it is from PWN / TKN_UMLS - the most fundamentally important concepts for our corpus (i.e. hypernyms and meronyms, being the top two most important). Some exceptions are if that category is included in another source, but a subcategory of that category is not and therefore would lose data from said source an example of this is the UMLS_TKN_SCA - or the syntactic category from UMLS. The SCA from UMLS includes parts of speech, which is in many databases, but it also have "complementizers" which are specific relations, but miscellaneous enough to keep this category despite POS redundancy.
